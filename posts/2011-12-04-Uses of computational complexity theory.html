List of uses of computational complexity theory

<li>Knowing complexity class won't solve your problem. </li>
<li>If you know complexity class of the problem and it falls in a class of efficiently 
solvable problems then you can use known algorithms to solve it.</li>
<li>You can prove that if you can't solve it nobody can.</li>
